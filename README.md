# AMAZON CLONE WITH REACT.JS | FIREBASE | STRIPE | AND MORE 🚀🚀🚀

_In this oportunity i want to share this project. This is an Amazon Clone when i used React.js | Firebase and other tools like SASS, STRIPE to the payment method, moment to the date and hour payment, react scroll, react currency format to the amount price, and of course for the routes i used react-router-dom 6.2.1, firebase v9. On the other hand, for keep the state i have used use context API to avoid passing the data from parent to child, however, in some events i used that  _

 _To the backend i used firebase cloud function and also firestore database to send and save the order client. Is very important to say that the login i used firebase authentication too_
